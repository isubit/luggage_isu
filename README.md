Below is the brief run-down on how to install Luggage_ISU. The full installation documentation can be found [here](http://luggagedocs.info/installing-luggage-scratch).

#####Assumptions:
* Drush is installed

Clone this repo into the root directory that your web server points to.

Run the build script found within the *scripts* directory:
```
bash scripts/build_luggage_isu.sh
